/**
 * Access to a folder the user picked, through the Storage Access Framework.
 *
 * This exists because scoped storage will not let the app walk the folder a
 * user keeps their disks in.
 * The obvious permission for that is MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, which Play
 * treats as a sensitive permission: an undeclared one blocks the release
 * outright, and declaring it means passing a review aimed at file managers,
 * backup and antivirus apps. Rather than gate every future update on that
 * review, the user grants one folder through the system picker and the grant
 * is persisted across reboots and app restarts.
 *
 * What SAF hands back is a content:// document tree, not a path, and VICE
 * opens .d64 and .tap images with plain POSIX calls. Nothing is imported for
 * it: the tree is enumerated to build the library, the user's files stay
 * exactly where they put them, and [copyDocument] materialises only the one
 * title being launched into the cache, where VICE can open it by path.
