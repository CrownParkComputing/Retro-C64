// Shared-storage permission handling (Android only).
//
// Why this exists: on Android 11+ the app could LIST the user's
// /storage/emulated/0/Vice/Games tree without any permission, so the
// library grid filled up with titles -- but reading a file's bytes returned
// nothing, so the native core got a path it could not open and the emulator
// screen came up blank with no explanation. .d64/.t64/.tap/.prg are not
// images/video/audio, so READ_MEDIA_* does not apply; "All files access"
// (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) is what actually grants the read.
//
// Implemented as a two-method platform channel into MainActivity.kt rather
// than via the permission_handler package: that package's current Android
// artifact does not compile against this project's Gradle/Kotlin setup, and
// all we need is isExternalStorageManager() plus the Settings intent.
//
// The permission cannot be granted by an in-app dialog -- request() sends
// the user out to a system Settings toggle -- so callers must re-check when
// the app comes back rather than trusting the immediate return value.
